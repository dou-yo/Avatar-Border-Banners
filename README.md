# Avatar-Border-Banners
A collection of banners inspired by the avatar borders in Rocket League for the new AlphaConsole banner update!

To install, go to #beta-banners in the AlphaConsole Discord server.

YOU DO NOT NEED TO CHANGE THE BRIGHTNESS OF ANY OF THE BANNERS.

Let me know what you think and what I should do next.

Hope you enjoy! :)
